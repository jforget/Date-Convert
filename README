Date::Convert 0.17 pre-alpha by Mordechai T. Abzug
and Jean Forget <JFORGET at cpan dot org>

Allows you to convert date formats using an OO mechanism that lets you
easily choose any two formats and add in new ones. Example:

  use Date::Convert;
  my $today = Date::Convert::Gregorian->new(2020, 10, 12);
  print "Gregorian: ", $today->date_string, "\n";
  # ---> Gregorian: 2020 Oct 12

  Date::Convert::Julian->convert($today);
  print "Julian: ", $today->date_string, "\n";
  # ---> Julian: 2020 Sep 29

  Date::Convert::Hebrew->convert($today);
  print "Hebrew: ", $today->date_string, "\n";
  # ---> Hebrew: 5781 Tishrei 24

  Date::Convert::Absolute->convert($today);
  print "Julian Day Number at noon: ", $today->date_string, "\n";
  # ---> Julian Day Number at noon: 2459135

At the moment, the only documentation is the man page.  That's not
surprising, since it *is* pre-alpha.  And of course, since it's pre-alpha,
'tis subject to change, and is unreliable.

Install the normal way, using cpanminus or the CPAN shell, or by running
the usual commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
