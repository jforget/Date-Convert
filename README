Date::Convert 0.17 pre-alpha by Mordechai T. Abzug <morty@umbc.edu>

Allows you to convert date formats using an OO mechanism that lets you
easily choose any two formats and add in new ones.

At the moment, the only documentation is the man page.  That's not
surprising, since it *is* pre-alpha.  And of course, since it's pre-alpha,
'tis subject to change, and is unreliable.

Install the normal way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you have suggestions, bug reports, or if you want to add a new date
format, feel free to contact me:  morty@sanctuary.arbutus.md.us

If you want to be on the announcement list for new releases, send a mail
with "subscribe" as the first line of the body to:
